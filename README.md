A Python interface for Minecraft built on [grpc](https://github.com/real-itu/minecraft-rpc).

### 1. Set-up

1. Install Java 8 -aka 1.8- (you can check your version with `java -version`)

   - Unix: `sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre`
   - OSX: 
     - `brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk`
     - `brew cask install adoptopenjdk8`
     - If troubles, check: [how to install Java on Mac OS](https://mkyong.com/java/how-to-install-java-on-mac-osx/) 
   - Windows: [Java 8 for Windows](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) 


2. Clone repo and install grpc:

   - `git clone https://github.com/real-itu/Evocraft-py`
   - `pip install grpcio`


### 2. Starting the modded Minecraft server

1. From `Evocraft-py`, start the server with `java -jar spongevanilla-1.12.2-7.3.0.jar`
2. The first time you try to start the server a texfile eula.txt with be generated, you need to modifying its last line to `eula=true` to accept the Minecraft EULA. Now running `java -jar spongevanilla-1.12.2-7.3.0.jar` will start the server
3. You should see a bunch of outputs including `[... INFO]: Listening on 5001`. 
This means it's working and the Minecraft server is ready for commands on port 5001.

**Note**: if you get an SSL error in step 1, try another connection (Institutions like labs can block access).
	

### 3. Spawn blocks on the Minecraft server with Python 

There are three methods at the core of the API: `spawnBlocks` spawns a set of different blocks,
`fillCube` spawns a single type of block over a cubic volume and `readCube` which reads currently spawned blocks within a space.

If you aren't a seasoned Minecraft scholar, you can check [information about different Minecraft blocks](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Block).

Here's [example](example.py) on how to spawn a flying machine with python (you'll need to have started the modded Minecraft server before):

```python
import grpc

import minecraft_pb2_grpc
from minecraft_pb2 import *

channel = grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:5001')
client = minecraft_pb2_grpc.MinecraftServiceStub(channel)

client.fillCube(FillCubeRequest(  # Clear a 20x10x20 working area
    cube=Cube(
        min=Point(x=-10, y=4, z=-10),
        max=Point(x=10, y=14, z=10)
    ),
    type=AIR
))
client.spawnBlocks(Blocks(blocks=[  # Spawn a flying machine
    # Lower layer
    Block(position=Point(x=1, y=5, z=1), type=PISTON, orientation=NORTH),
    Block(position=Point(x=1, y=5, z=0), type=SLIME, orientation=NORTH),
    Block(position=Point(x=1, y=5, z=-1), type=STICKY_PISTON, orientation=SOUTH),
    Block(position=Point(x=1, y=5, z=-2), type=PISTON, orientation=NORTH),
    Block(position=Point(x=1, y=5, z=-4), type=SLIME, orientation=NORTH),
    # Upper layer
    Block(position=Point(x=1, y=6, z=0), type=REDSTONE_BLOCK, orientation=NORTH),
    Block(position=Point(x=1, y=6, z=-4), type=REDSTONE_BLOCK, orientation=NORTH),
    # Activate
    Block(position=Point(x=1, y=6, z=-1), type=QUARTZ_BLOCK, orientation=NORTH),
]))
```

To read the blocks present within a set of coordinates use `readCube`:

```python
import grpc

import minecraft_pb2_grpc
from minecraft_pb2 import *

channel = grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:5001')
client = minecraft_pb2_grpc.MinecraftServiceStub(channel)

blocks = client.readCube(Cube(
         min=Point(x=0, y=0, z=0),
         max=Point(x=10, y=10, z=10)
))

print(blocks)
```


You can see the implemented Python methods at [minecraft_pb2_grpc.py](minecraft_pb2_grpc.py#L37).
For the general grpc definition please see [minecraft-rpc](https://github.com/real-itu/minecraft-rpc).

If you'd like to interface with the server using other languages than Python, you can use the interface definition file you can generate clients for (almost) any programming language you like. See [https://grpc.io/docs/languages/](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/) and [minecraft-rpc](https://github.com/real-itu/minecraft-rpc).

### 4. Rendering Minecraft

You can use the method `client.readCube` that allows to read which blocks are spawned, however, if you'd like to render Minecraft to see what your spawned creations look like or even interact with them, you'll need to buy and install [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net)

1. Install and launch Minecraft
2. Create a compatible version:
   1. `Installations` 
   2. `New`
   3. Give it a name
   4. Select version 1.12.2 
   5. `Create`
3. Launch it:
   1. `Play`
   2. `Multiplayer`
   3. `Direct Connect`
   4. On `Server Address` write `localhost` 
   5. `Join Server`

On the server command line, you can use /tp @p x y z to teleport yourself to position {x,y,z} in the world.

### 5. Useful commands that you can type in the running server console

- `defaultgamemode creative` to set the default mode to creative;
-  `setworldspawn x y z` to set the default player spawn point;
- `time set day` to set time to day;
- `gamerule doDaylightCycle false` stop the day/night cycle;
- `gamemode creative <player name>` set creative mode for a specific player (sometimes the default isn't working);
- `teleport <player name> x y z` teleport a player to x,y,z coordinates.
